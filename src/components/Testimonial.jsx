      <p className="test-info">I really enjoyed my sessions with Mrs. Christi. She talked me through so much and gave realistic steps to help me think about certain parts of life to get me where I needed. I loved that her sessions are God centered and we were able to talk through things making sure God was in the middle of all we are trying to accomplish through our sessions. She has so much passion for her work and put her all into coaching me through things I was dealing with. So appreciative of her and her work!</p>
